## Development Approach
- **Incremental Implementation**: Each task builds on the previous one
- **Task Isolation**: Complete one task fully before moving to the next
- **Agent Specialization**: All development work uses the modern-frontend-engineer agent
- **Context Preservation**: This file maintains all relevant context between tasks

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom hooks
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API with authentication interceptors
- **UI Components**: Custom components + Radix UI primitives
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## API Integration Points
- **Authentication**: `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints
- **Content Generation**: `/api/v1/generate/*` endpoints  
- **Health Monitoring**: `/api/v1/health` and `/actuator/health`
- **Image Serving**: Local image URLs for generated content

## Current Status
- **Active Task**: Task 2 - User Profile Management and Dashboard Foundation  
- **Last Completed**: Task 1 - Project Setup and Authentication Foundation ✅
- **Next Action**: Ready to begin Task 2 when requested
- **Context**: All task specifications are detailed in `.claude/task_*.md` files

## Task 1 Completion Summary ✅ FULLY COMPLETED
