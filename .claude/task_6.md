# Task 6: Content History and Management System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive content history and management system that allows users to view, search, filter, and manage all their previous content generations. This task creates the interface for accessing and organizing historical content.

## Functional Requirements
- Display complete history of user's content generations
- Show previous generations in list/grid view with previews
- Implement filtering by platform type, date range, and status
- Add search functionality within generation history
- Allow users to re-access and copy previous generations
- Implement bulk operations (delete multiple, export multiple)
- Add categorization/tagging system for generated content
- Create favorites/bookmarking system for generated content
- Support content export in various formats

## Technical Requirements

### History Display System
- Create paginated content history views
- Implement list and grid layout options
- Design content preview cards
- Add sorting options (date, platform, status)
- Create infinite scroll or pagination

### Search and Filtering
- Implement text search across content
- Create filter interface for platforms
- Add date range picker filtering
- Filter by generation status
- Create tag-based filtering
- Implement combined filter states

### Content Organization
- Add tagging system for content
- Implement favorites/bookmarking
- Create content categories
- Allow custom organization methods
- Support bulk tagging operations

### Bulk Operations
- Multi-select functionality for content items
- Bulk delete operations
- Bulk export functionality
- Bulk tagging/categorization
- Batch operation progress tracking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] History displays all user's previous generations
- [ ] Search finds content across all text fields
- [ ] Filters work independently and in combination
- [ ] Date range filtering works accurately
- [ ] Content previews show key information clearly
- [ ] Bulk operations work reliably for selected items
- [ ] Tagging system allows organization of content
- [ ] Favorites system allows quick access to preferred content
- [ ] Export functionality works for multiple formats
- [ ] Performance remains good with large content history

## Data Management
- Local storage for content metadata
- Indexing for search functionality  
- Caching strategies for performance
- Data synchronization with backend
- Cleanup of old/unused content

## Search Implementation
- Full-text search across content fields
- Search result highlighting
- Search history and suggestions
- Advanced search operators
- Real-time search results

## Filter Categories
- Platform types (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Blog)
- Generation status (Completed, Failed, In Progress)
- Date ranges (Today, This Week, This Month, Custom)
- Content types (With Images, Text Only)
- User-defined tags and categories

## Export Formats
- JSON format for complete data
- Plain text for content only
- CSV for spreadsheet import
- PDF for formatted presentation
- Platform-specific formats

## Bulk Operations
- Select all/none functionality
- Multi-page selection handling
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Undo functionality where possible

## Performance Considerations
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Lazy loading of content previews
- Efficient search indexing
- Optimized filtering algorithms
- Pagination or infinite scroll

## Dependencies
- Search libraries (fuse.js for fuzzy search)
- Date handling libraries (date-fns)
- Export utilities (file-saver, csv-writer)
- Virtual scrolling libraries

## Notes
- Focus on discoverability of historical content
- Ensure search performance with large datasets
- Plan for data migration and versioning
- Consider implementing content analytics
- Design for future collaboration features
