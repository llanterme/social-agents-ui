## Development Approach
- **Incremental Implementation**: Each task builds on the previous one
- **Task Isolation**: Complete one task fully before moving to the next
- **Agent Specialization**: All development work uses the modern-frontend-engineer agent
- **Context Preservation**: This file maintains all relevant context between tasks

## Technical Stack

## Important Notes
- Each task must be completed fully before proceeding to the next
- Use the modern-frontend-engineer agent for ALL development work
- Maintain this CLAUDE.md file with current progress and context
- Reference FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md for complete API documentation

- ✅ Backend OAuth flow properly integrated
- ✅ Connection details display (profile ID, connected date, token expiry)

### Key Implementation Details:
- **Service Layer**: `src/lib/linkedin.ts` - Handles all LinkedIn API calls
- **Hooks**: `src/hooks/useLinkedIn.ts` - React hooks for connection and posting
- **Components**:
  - `LinkedInConnection.tsx` - Profile page connection card
  - `LinkedInPostButton.tsx` - Post to LinkedIn button
  - `LinkedInConnectionStatus.tsx` - Global connection monitor
- **Routes**:
  - `/settings/connections` - OAuth callback handler
  - `/connections/success` and `/connections/error` - Alternative callback pages

### OAuth Flow:
1. User clicks "Connect LinkedIn Account" → Frontend calls backend
2. Backend returns LinkedIn authorization URL
3. User authorizes on LinkedIn → Redirects to backend callback
4. Backend processes OAuth → Redirects to frontend `/settings/connections?status=success`
5. Frontend shows success → Auto-redirects to profile
